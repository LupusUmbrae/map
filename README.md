D&amp;D Map Editor
===

This is a somewhat ambitious project, the idea is to make not only a decent user friendly D&amp;D map editor it will also be able to display both a screen to the players and a DM only screen

It's also a good chance for me to learn SDL

Dependencies
* MinGW
* SDL2
* SDL2 Image
* SDL2 Font
* JsonCPP
 
Also require a fix to minGw's io.h the references of "off64 _ t" to "_ off64_t" (without spaces, sorry formatting issues for _) see: http://sourceforge.net/p/mingw/bugs/2024/
